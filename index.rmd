knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r df, include=FALSE}
df = data.table::fread("data.csv")
df
```

## The leaderboard

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r summ, echo=FALSE, dependson=df}
df[, pts := 0]
df[, pts := num_attendees - p1s + 1 + pts]

summ = df[,.(github = paste(github), pts = sum(pts)), .(team)]
summ[order(pts, decreasing=T), rank:=1:.N]
DT::datatable(summ)
```

# README

```{r plot, dependson = summ}
barplot(summ$pts, xlab = summ$team)
```
